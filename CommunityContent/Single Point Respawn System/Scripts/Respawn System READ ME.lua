-- I made this Respawn system because i needed a way to move a single spawn point, insteadof having many throught a linier level. 
-- i included 3 spawn points based on where they were in my project at the time. So either move the trigger boxes where you need 
--or delete the extra 2 and duplicate the 1 left. Make sure to delete any extra spawn points as the scripts only search for 1. 


--Uploading this to move it around my own projects but firgured someone out there might need use for it too
